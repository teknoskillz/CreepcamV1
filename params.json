Focuses on (2) clients not just one, has autoswitch function.\r\n   \r\nSource code for original Creepcam chase cam used in Quake. Embedded in original progs.dat type structure.\r\nCompiles with some warnings in compiler, most are easily fixed. Further Installation instructions hopefully to follow here soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
