Uses SVC_VIEWPORT as part of its main \r\n   component, focuses on (2) clients not just one.\r\n   \r\n   \r\nSource code for original Creepcam chase cam used in Quake. Embedded in original progs.dat type structure.\r\nCompiles with some warnings in compiler, most are easilly fixed. Further Installation instructions hopefully to follow here soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
